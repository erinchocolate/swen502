![Demo](https://github.com/erinchocolate/swen502/blob/master/HCI%20Assignment/Demo.gif)

This project is mainly to learn User Experience design.

We created user personas, information architecture, use cases, wireframes and prototype of a personal finance management app.

## Product

We are creating a personal finance management app for young professionals looking to manage and keep track of their finances in an easy way.

## Problems we try to solve

- Track expenses and income automatically 
- Separate and manage finances from different aspects of life
- Keep finance on track

## Features

- Track expenses and income automatically
  - Users can link their bank card with their sub-account.
  - Expenses and income will load into app from their bank transactions automatically.
  - They can still manual add expense or income when they need to.
- Separate and manage finances from different aspects of life
  - Users can setup multiple sub-accounts under one profile.
  - If a user is flatting with others, he/she can set up two sub accounts, one is for his/her personal finance, the other is for flat finance.

- Keep finance on track
  - Users can set up budget weekly or monthly. When they spend over their budget, they will receive overspending notification.
  - They can also set up saving goals. Saving notifications and progress bar give users instant feedback to help them work towards their financial goals.
