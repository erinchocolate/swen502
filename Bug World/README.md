# Bug World

The program emulates a world with bugs, plants and obstacles.

Bugs have its species, a symbol and energy. It can move within the world.

Bugs have two ways of moving:

- Random move
- Smell the food
  - If the different between a plant's coordinates and bug's coordinates is no more than 3, then the bug will move towards the plant.

Plants have size, which represents by numbers.

Obstacles can not move. They are in the way of bugs.
