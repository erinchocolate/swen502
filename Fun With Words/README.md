# Fun with words

This program uses arraylist, hashset and hashmap to store words from different books and calculate word frequency.

I compare the speed of loading file into arraylist and hashmap.

In hashmap example:

- I use a comparator to sort the outputs alphabetically
- I use a comparator to sort the outputs by the number of times a word is in the book
